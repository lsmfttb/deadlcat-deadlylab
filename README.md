## deadlycat-deadlylab

This repository includes Deadlycat's work on labs in CS:APP3e course (http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html).

### Data Lab

An easy lab, placed In **./datalab-handout/**. Only changed **bits.c**.

### Bomb Lab

A lab which needs few codes, placed in **./bomb/**. Deadlycat's solution is in **ans.txt**; unfortunately Deadlycat did not write down the solving process. 

### Attack Lab

Another lab which needs few codes, placed in **./target1/**. Deadlycat's solutions (input strings) are in **str1~5.txt**, and those strings were converted by hexademical numbers in **hex1~5.txt**.

### Architecture Lab

Deadlycat did not work on this lab, because it is not assigned in CS:APP3e course. 

### Cache Lab

A lab with tricky optimization, placed in **./cachelab-handout/**. Only changed **csim.c** and **trans.c** (also in **deadlycat-handin.tar**). Deadlycat did not get full score in optimizing. :(

### Shell Lab

A lab with 

^CJob [1] (66895) terminated by signal 2

A lab placed in **./shlab-handout/**. Only changed **tsh.c**. Unfortunately no comments.

### Malloc Lab

Another lab with tricky optimization, placed in **./cachelab-handout/**. Only changed **mm.c**. Deadlycat is busy, so Deadlycat just made some simple optimizations. Deadlycat did not get full score in optimizing. :(

### Proxy Lab

Deadlycat has not finished it yet.
